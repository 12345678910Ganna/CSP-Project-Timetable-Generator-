## 🚀 Key Features

### 🧠 1. Automatic Timetable Generation

    Uses a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)–based algorithm to automatically generate conflict-free timetables by assigning lectures, instructors, rooms, and time slots efficiently.

### ⚙️ 2. Dual Mode Functionality

    🔹 Auto Mode: Instantly generates full timetables for any level or major.

    🔹 Manual Mode: Lets users customize course selections and generate timetables manually.

### 📚 3. Comprehensive Course Database

    Supports 4 levels and 4 majors (CNC, AID, CSC, BIF) including all core and elective courses, with over 49 instructors, 14 lecture rooms, and 42 labs.

### 👩‍🏫 4. Instructor Constraint System

    🧑‍🔬 Professors: Teach only lectures (LEC).

    👩‍💻 Teaching Assistants (TAs): Handle labs (LAB) and tutorials (TUT).
        Ensures realistic scheduling that follows department rules.

### 🏫 5. Smart Room Assignment

    Automatically picks suitable rooms based on session type (lecture/lab) and prevents room/time conflicts across the entire timetable.

### ✏️ 6. Editable Timetable

    Every generated session can be edited or deleted using a clean and modern modal interface — updates happen instantly.

### 📤 7. Export Functionality

    Easily export timetables to CSV format for external use (e.g., Excel or database integration).

### 📊 8. Real-Time Statistics

  Displays key performance metrics including:

    📘 Total Courses

    🧩 Total Sessions

    🚫 Constraint Violations

    ⚡ Generation Time

### 🌙 9. Modern & Responsive UI

  Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript featuring:

    ☀️ Light / Dark Theme Toggle

    📱 Fully Responsive Design for mobile and desktop.

### ⚡ 10. Performance Efficiency

    Generates complete, conflict-free timetables in milliseconds (0 ms generation time) — optimized for speed and reliability.
